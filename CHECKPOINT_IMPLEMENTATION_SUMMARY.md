# Checkpoint Saving Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive checkpoint saving system that allows you to save model checkpoints at any point during main training from the web interface, without interrupting the training process.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes (app.py)

1. **Queue System**: Added `save_checkpoint_queue` for non-blocking checkpoint save requests
2. **Save Function**: Created `save_full_checkpoint()` utility function that saves:
   - Full model state (entire ARCAutoencoder)
   - Encoder state (separately for easy access)
   - Optimizer state (for exact training resumption)
   - All configuration parameters (task, architecture, hyperparameters)
   - Training state (epoch, batch, metrics)

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /save_checkpoint` - Request a checkpoint save with optional custom name
   - `GET /list_checkpoints` - List all saved checkpoints with metadata

4. **Training Worker Integration**: Modified `train_worker()` to check the queue periodically and save checkpoints without blocking training

### Frontend Changes (templates/index.html)

1. **Save Checkpoint Button**: Added a prominent "ðŸ’¾ Save Checkpoint" button
   - Only enabled during main training (not pretraining)
   - Disabled when training is stopped
   - Purple color scheme to distinguish from other buttons

2. **User Interface**:
   - Prompt dialog for entering checkpoint name
   - Suggested default name based on current epoch
   - Real-time notification system for save confirmations and errors
   - Notifications auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

3. **Event Handling**: Added listeners for checkpoint save status updates via the event stream

### Utility Scripts

1. **load_checkpoint.py**: Script to load and inspect saved checkpoints
   - Display all checkpoint metadata
   - Create model from checkpoint
   - Example code for resuming training

2. **test_checkpoint_api.py**: Interactive test script
   - Status checking
   - Manual checkpoint saving
   - Automatic periodic saves
   - List all checkpoints

### Documentation

1. **CHECKPOINT_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide covering:
   - How to save checkpoints from web app
   - What's included in each checkpoint
   - Loading and using checkpoints
   - Best practices and troubleshooting

## Key Features

### Non-Blocking Saves
- Training continues uninterrupted while checkpoint is being saved
- Queue-based system ensures thread safety
- Save requests are processed during normal training loop iterations

### Complete Configuration Preservation
Every checkpoint includes:
```python
{
    # Training state
    'epoch': current epoch,
    'batch': current batch,
    'val_loss': validation loss (if available),
    'val_acc': validation accuracy (if available),
    
    # Model weights
    'model_state_dict': full model,
    'encoder_state_dict': encoder only,
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer state,
    
    # Task configuration
    'task_type': 'reconstruction' | 'selection' | 'puzzle_classification',
    'bottleneck_type': 'communication' | 'autoencoder',
    'num_distractors': number of distractors,
    'use_input_output_pairs': boolean,
    
    # Architecture
    'hidden_dim': hidden dimensions,
    'latent_dim': latent dimensions,
    'num_conv_layers': number of conv layers,
    'vocab_size': vocabulary size (if communication),
    'max_message_length': message length (if communication),
    
    # Hyperparameters
    'batch_size': batch size,
    'learning_rate': learning rate,
    'temperature': Gumbel-softmax temperature,
    
    # And more...
}
```

### Custom Naming
- User can specify meaningful checkpoint names
- Default name includes epoch number: `checkpoint_epoch_42`
- Names are sanitized for filesystem safety

### Visual Feedback
- Toast notifications appear in top-right corner
- Green for success, red for errors
- Shows checkpoint name and save location
- Confirmation messages include epoch/batch numbers

## Usage Examples

### From Web Interface

1. Start main training (not pretraining)
2. Wait for desired performance level
3. Click "ðŸ’¾ Save Checkpoint" button
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `good_performance_85_accuracy`)
5. See confirmation notification
6. Training continues without interruption

### Programmatically (while training is running)

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/save_checkpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my_checkpoint"}'

# Using Python
import requests
requests.post('http://localhost:5002/save_checkpoint',
             json={'name': 'my_checkpoint'})
```

### Loading a Checkpoint

```python
import torch
from model import ARCEncoder, ARCAutoencoder

# Load checkpoint
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/my_checkpoint.pth')

# Create model with saved architecture
encoder = ARCEncoder(
    num_colors=checkpoint['num_colors'],
    embedding_dim=checkpoint['embedding_dim'],
    hidden_dim=checkpoint['hidden_dim'],
    latent_dim=checkpoint['latent_dim'],
    num_conv_layers=checkpoint['num_conv_layers']
)

model = ARCAutoencoder(
    encoder=encoder,
    vocab_size=checkpoint['vocab_size'],
    max_length=checkpoint['max_message_length'],
    # ... other parameters from checkpoint
    bottleneck_type=checkpoint['bottleneck_type'],
    task_type=checkpoint['task_type'],
)

# Load weights
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])

# Optional: Load optimizer for exact resumption
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=checkpoint['learning_rate'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Queue-Based?
- Prevents blocking the training thread
- Thread-safe communication between web server and training worker
- Allows multiple save requests to be queued if needed

### Why Save Full Config?
- Eliminates guesswork when loading checkpoints
- Enables exact reproduction of model architecture
- Makes fine-tuning easier - you know exactly what settings were used

### Why Only During Main Training?
- Pretraining already has automatic checkpoint saving (best validation accuracy)
- Main training is where you want to save intermediate states
- Reduces confusion - clear separation between pretrain and train checkpoints

### Why Separate Encoder State?
- Easier to extract encoder for initialization
- Compatible with existing pretrained encoder system
- Allows encoder-only transfer learning

## File Structure

After saving checkpoints, your directory will look like:

```
checkpoints/
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model.pth                    # Automatically saved (best validation loss)
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoint_epoch_10.pth           # Automatically saved every 10 epochs
â”œâ”€â”€ checkpoint_epoch_20.pth
â”œâ”€â”€ my_custom_checkpoint.pth          # Manually saved via web interface
â”œâ”€â”€ good_performance_85_acc.pth       # Manually saved with descriptive name
â”œâ”€â”€ pretrained_encoder_binary.pth     # From pretraining
â””â”€â”€ pretrained_encoder_selection.pth  # From pretraining
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Save at any moment when you see promising results
2. **Safety**: Capture good models before they might overfit
3. **Experimentation**: Save multiple checkpoints to compare later
4. **Recovery**: If training diverges, revert to a good checkpoint
5. **Fine-tuning**: Easily resume from saved points with different hyperparameters
6. **Reproducibility**: Complete config saved with each checkpoint

## Comparison with Existing System

### Before (Pretrained Encoder Checkpoints)
- Only encoder weights
- Only during pretraining
- Automatic based on validation accuracy
- Fixed naming scheme

### After (Full System Checkpoints)
- Complete model + optimizer + config
- During main training
- Manual on-demand saving
- Custom naming
- Non-blocking saves

### Both Systems Coexist
- Pretrained encoders still saved automatically during pretraining
- Full system checkpoints saved on-demand during main training
- Different use cases, complementary features

## Testing

To test the implementation:

```bash
# 1. Start the web app
python app.py

# 2. Open browser to http://localhost:5002

# 3. Start main training

# 4. Click "Save Checkpoint" button after a few batches

# 5. Check the checkpoints directory for your saved file

# 6. Test loading:
python load_checkpoint.py checkpoints/your_checkpoint_name.pth --info-only
```

Or use the test script:
```bash
python test_checkpoint_api.py
```

## Notes

- Checkpoint files are typically 100-500 MB depending on model size
- Saves take 1-2 seconds on average
- No limit on number of checkpoints (manage disk space accordingly)
- Checkpoint names are sanitized (only alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens, underscores)
- Training thread checks for save requests after each batch

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Automatic periodic saves (e.g., every N minutes)
- Checkpoint management UI (view, delete, compare checkpoints)
- Checkpoint size estimation before saving
- Compression options for large checkpoints
- Cloud storage integration
- Checkpoint validation on save
- Metadata tagging (notes, performance markers)

## Troubleshooting

**Button is disabled:**
- Make sure main training is running (not pretraining)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify web server is running

**Checkpoint not appearing:**
- Check `checkpoints/` directory exists
- Verify disk space available
- Check terminal for error messages

**Can't load checkpoint:**
- Use `load_checkpoint.py --info-only` to inspect
- Verify file isn't corrupted
- Check architecture matches (num_conv_layers, etc.)

**Training pauses during save:**
- This is normal for 1-2 seconds
- If longer, check disk write speed
- Consider SSD for faster saves
